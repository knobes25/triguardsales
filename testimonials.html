                                <p>"Before joining TriGuard's team, I never imagined myself ever becoming a salesman. In
                                    fact, I thought sales people were annoying and often times unethical. TriGuard
                                    taught me
                                    that I don't need to be a typical "Sales Bro" or lower my standards in order to
                                    succeed,
                                    so I took a risk and signed up.
                                    I had a great first summer; I made great money and great memories, all while
                                    maintaining
                                    my integrity. Now, after a few years with TriGuard, I feel obligated to share my
                                    experience with others and allow them to experience the same thing. I love my job
                                    and
                                    love my company. Give us a shot, and I'm sure you will too."

                        <p>"This was my first year selling pest control and I'm very happy I went with TriGuard. I
                            did significantly better than I was expecting and it was because of the support I
                            received from my managers and co-workers. I had 2 managers in my office who were solely
                            dedicated to my success and the success of the other guys selling. Instead of focusing
                            on selling their own accounts, they spent all day making sure everything ran smoothly
                            for us and would come knock with us to help us improve. We also have the best
                            technicians who care about our customers and do a good, thorough job treating homes. One
                            of my main concerns about selling door to door was feeling like I was being dishonest or
                            deceptive. However, this summer I learned that you can be successful while still being
                            respectful and honest. Overall, working for Triguard has been a great experience and a
                            huge blessing financially. I'm glad I gave summer sales a shot."

                        <p>"Prior to TriGuard, I previously sold for another pest control company. I appreciate that
                            TriGuard is a family owned company that invests in their employees' success both at work
                            and outside of work. I tend to be a little competitive, so I also enjoy the incentives
                            and contests. Prior to coming back this year, I established my overall goals for the
                            season and broke
                            them down to weekly and daily goals. I have always closely tracked my average contract
                            value, daily sales vs. accounts serviced, weekly sales and monthly sales. I focused on
                            removing distractions from meeting my goals and instead focused on consistency. I am
                            constantly looking at ways to better connect with my customers to gain their trust and
                            demonstrate value in our service. I seek feedback from my peers and am willing to help
                            others when needed. I also like to work closely with our techs to let them know we
                            appreciate them taking care of the customers."

                        <p>"Working for Tri Guard has been rewarding to say the least. The experiences I have earned
                            not only reflect monetary value but practical skills as well. Some of the things I feel
                            like I have learned include: having an increased ability to concur challenging goals no
                            matter how many voices are telling you that you can’t do it, increased confidence when
                            it comes to speaking or presenting myself, and the ability to take no for an answer and
                            be okay with that. The culture here is hard work with a fun environment and plenty of
                            rewarding incentives and fun company activities. This summer has been one I haven’t
                            looked back on with regret."

                            managers of TriGuard who quickly became my friend. The first thing that I noticed was
                            the honesty he had about the job and it’s requirements while recruiting me, I was able
                            to quickly get to know the company and all the fun things we do. I have many friends and
                            family members that sell for different companies and none of them have nearly the amount
                            of perks as this company does. This company is definitely one of the best and I am so
