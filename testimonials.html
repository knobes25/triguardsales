                            <p>"Before joining TriGuard's team, I never imagined myself ever becoming a salesman. In
                                fact, I thought sales people were annoying and often times unethical. TriGuard
                                taught me
                                that I don't need to be a typical "Sales Bro" or lower my standards in order to
                                succeed,
                                so I took a risk and signed up.
                                I had a great first summer; I made great money and great memories, all while
                                maintaining
                                my integrity. Now, after a few years with TriGuard, I feel obligated to share my
                                experience with others and allow them to experience the same thing. I love my job
                                and
                                love my company. Give us a shot, and I'm sure you will too."

                            <p>"This was my first year selling pest control and I'm very happy I went with TriGuard. I
                                did significantly better than I was expecting and it was because of the support I
                                received from my managers and co-workers. I had 2 managers in my office who were solely
                                dedicated to my success and the success of the other guys selling. Instead of focusing
                                on selling their own accounts, they spent all day making sure everything ran smoothly
                                for us and would come knock with us to help us improve. We also have the best
                                technicians who care about our customers and do a good, thorough job treating homes. One
                                of my main concerns about selling door to door was feeling like I was being dishonest or
                                deceptive. However, this summer I learned that you can be successful while still being
                                respectful and honest. Overall, working for TriGuard has been a great experience and a
                                huge blessing financially. I'm glad I gave summer sales a shot."

                                TriGuard is a family owned company that invests in their employees' success both at work
                                and outside of work. I tend to be a little competitive, so I also enjoy the incentives
                                and contests. Prior to coming back this year, I established my overall goals for the
                                season and broke
                                them down to weekly and daily goals. I have always closely tracked my average contract
                                value, daily sales vs. accounts serviced, weekly sales and monthly sales. I focused on
                                removing distractions from meeting my goals and instead focused on consistency. I am
                                constantly looking at ways to better connect with my customers to gain their trust and
                                demonstrate value in our service. I seek feedback from my peers and am willing to help
                                others when needed. I also like to work closely with our techs to let them know we
                                appreciate them taking care of the customers."

                                like I have learned include: having an increased ability to concur challenging goals no
                                matter how many voices are telling you that you can’t do it, increased confidence when
                                it comes to speaking or presenting myself, and the ability to take no for an answer and
                                be okay with that. The culture here is hard work with a fun environment and plenty of
                                rewarding incentives and fun company activities. This summer has been one I haven’t

                                first summer. The company didn't only help me with sales, but they have helped me start
                                my own side business, helped me purchase a vehicle, and have taught me about investments
                                and how to use money wisely to get me ahead in life. The management in the company
